# CareHippos

The CareHippos App is a decentralized application designed to allow users to submit their mood within the context of their communities, helping track the overall mental health and well-being of the community. Whether itâ€™s an office department, a DAO, a hospital floor, or a hackathon sponsor, this app provides a simple and effective way to assess a community's emotional state.

By enabling users to vote via "mood submission", the app aggregates these votes to give a real-time, reputational, and quantitative assessment of the community's health. It helps community administrators identify potential conflicts, stress levels, and overall mood trends, empowering them to take action where needed.

The smart contracts are deployed on Morph Holesky Testnet.
